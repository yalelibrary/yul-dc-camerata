Notes:

  1. you must use platform version 1.4.0, the default and (ironically) 
  LATEST version referred to in the documentation is 1.3.5, this won't work.
  At some point LATEST will point to 1.4.0, and this won't be an issue.

  The pre-release version of ecs-ci that we use has a known issue in their
  tracker that it specifies the wrong platform version when efs volumes are
  detected.  For now, the workaround is to upgrade in the aws console (goto
  cluster->update cluster, select platform version 1.4.0 and click through the
  rest. This only has to be done once. Verify things happened by noting the
  platform version displayed in the task section of the cluster screen.

  2. you have to set up efs client access policy, a sample is included,
  and should be applied to the efs resource (there's a tiny "manage client
  access" link on its details page in the efs management console).  This will
  fix "server access denied" errors.  In the future, we should be using efs
  access points, but i haven't been able to get them working correctly yet.
  the access policy allows access from any aws principal, which should probably 
  be trimmed down, but i'm not a wizard.
